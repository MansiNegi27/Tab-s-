# Tab-s-
Tab(s), is a chrome web extension which keeps a record of all the tabs that are active in the browser. It stores the URLs of the tabs open, in LocalAppData. On creating a new window, a tab is created which shows the URLs of the stored tabs. You can restore/ delete the tabs from there and can also download a copy of the URLs. This saves the user from bookmarking the tabs or pinning them. 
Moreover, it avoids problems, normally encountered with pinned tabs: they are not synchronized.
